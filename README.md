🎯 Gesture Recognition Features
Supported Gestures:

✋ Open Palm → Hover/Stop
✊ Fist → Land
✌️ Peace Sign → Takeoff
👍 Thumbs Up → Ascend
👌 OK Sign → Descend
👉 Pointing → Move in direction (up/down/left/right)
🖐️ Finger Counting → Speed levels (1-5 fingers)
📍 Hand Position → Positional control based on hand location in frame

🔧 Key Components Added

GestureRecognizer Class - Handles all gesture detection logic
Finger Detection - Accurately determines which fingers are extended
Gesture Stability - Uses history buffer to prevent jittery recognition
Visual Feedback - Shows recognized gestures, confidence, and control zones
Position Control - Maps hand center position to movement commands
Command Processing - Translates gestures into drone commands

🎮 Control Methods
Discrete Gestures: Specific hand shapes trigger specific actions
Positional Control: Hand location in frame controls movement direction
Speed Control: Number of extended fingers sets speed/intensity levels
🛡️ Safety Features

Confidence thresholds prevent accidental commands
Gesture history smoothing reduces false positives
Clear visual feedback shows what gesture is recognized
Emergency gestures (fist for land) for quick stops

🔌 Integration Ready
The process_drone_command() function is where you'd integrate with your specific drone SDK (DJI Tello, PX4, etc.). Currently it prints commands, but you can replace those with actual drone API calls.
The code now provides a robust foundation for gesture-controlled drone flight with intuitive hand movements!
